You have to click within the x-coordinates of the paddle for the ball to move and the game to begin. Otherwise it might not always initiate and you might lose turns.

The game_config object contains properties used to configure the game, including the pixel increment amount of the ball (dx, dy), dimensions for various game objects, a 'points' counter and others.

Enjoy :)
